Implementation of Password Complexity Checker

Objective: Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

Procedure :- The program checks passwords against various criteria to determine their strength. Criteria Considered: Minimum length of 8 characters. At least 1 lowercase alphabet. At least 1 uppercase alphabet. At least 1 numeric digit. At least 1 special character (non-alphanumeric). Suggested Password: If the provided password doesn't meet all criteria, the program suggests an example password that fulfills the requirements. Menu-based Interface: Offers a simple menu-based interface for users to check passwords or exit the program. Input Validation: Handles invalid input gracefully, prompting users to enter valid options.
